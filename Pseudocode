Pseudocode
Create three classes for a rectangle, triangle, and trapezoid
User Input:
  Print instructions out to user
  Allow user to pick which shape they want calculations for
  Gather user input for each variable needed
  Length and width for rectangle
  Length, width, diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 for triangle
  Length, width 1, width 2, diagonal 1, diagonal 2 for trapezoid
Rectangle
  Calculate area with formula (length*width)
  Calculate perimeter with formula (2* length + 2*width)
Triangle
  Calculate area with formula ((length*width) / 2)
  Calculate perimeter with formula (width+diagonal 1+ diagonal 2)
Trapezoid
  Calculate area with formula ((width 1 + width 2) / 2 * length)
  Calculate perimeter with formula (width 1 + width 2 + diagonal 1 + diagonal 2)
Main method
  Follow the general algorithm
